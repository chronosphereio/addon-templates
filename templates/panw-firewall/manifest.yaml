description: Palo Alto Networks (PANW) firewalls are next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) that provide advanced threat prevention, traffic visibility, and granular control across networks. They use deep packet inspection, application-aware policies, and integrated threat intelligence to detect and block malicious activity. Designed for scalability and automation, PANW firewalls help secure enterprise, cloud, and hybrid environments against modern cyber threats.
