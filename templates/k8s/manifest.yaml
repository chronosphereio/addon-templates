    description: Kube-state-metrics (ksm) is a simple service that listens to the
      kubernetes api server and generates metrics about the state of the objects.
      it is not focused on the health of the individual kubernetes components, but
      rather on the health of the various objects inside, such as deployments, nodes
      and pods.
